#What is this

This is a simple tutorial for building a todo CRUD application from this link
- https://testdriven.io/blog/fastapi-react/

##why did i do this?
This is something that I just wanted to test for how fastapi and react work together. It was also for the purpose of testing
 vim and how it would perform with a full stack application. Surprisingly, it performed somewhat well for me. I just need to configure a couple more things for it 
 like autocompleting code and seeing if there is a way for me to further format nerdtree to have a better looking structure
